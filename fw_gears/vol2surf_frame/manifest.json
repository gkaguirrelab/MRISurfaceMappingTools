This gear will find it. But make sure that you do not have two different images with the same name in your archive. If your input is an fmriprep output, you can enter the output spaces you used for the fmriprep analysis (e.g MNI152NLin6Sym). In this case, the gear will convert all of the output images in your fmriprep archive with that space name. Multiple output spaces can be entered by separating the names with spaces (e.g func MNI152NLin6Sym). lastly, if you have a zip archive containing a bunch of images (should not be in nested folders), you can enter 'all' without the single quotes and process all of the images in that archive",
